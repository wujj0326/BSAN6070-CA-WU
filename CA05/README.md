# Computer Assignment 05 

Applying `Logistic Regression` Algorithm to Cardiovascular Disease Data and `KNN` for Movie recommendation system

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
File Name: CA05_LR_KNN_Models.ipynb
```

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3
```

### Installing Packages

```
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib
Sklearn
Seaborn
```

## Running the codes

```
Run through all the codes in Python Notebook
Each code has a comment for clarifying the purpose

There are two sections in this notebook

The first is to use Logistic Regression to predict the Cardiovascular Disease risk (Yes/No)

The second is to use KNN to build a movie recommendation system. 
Moreover, to give the new movie "The post" five recommendations
```

### Break down into end to end tests

`Logistic Regression`:\
Accuracy:0.67\
AUC:0.69

`KNN`:\
The five recommendations for the post is:
12 Years a Slave,\
Hacksaw Ridge,\
Queen of Katwe,\
The Wind Rises,\
A Beautiful Mind
