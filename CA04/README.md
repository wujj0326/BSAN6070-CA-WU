# Computer Assignment 04 

Applying `Ensemble Model Classifier` Algorithm to Census Data

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
File Name: CA04_Ensemble_Models.ipynb
```

### Prerequisites

```
Python 3
CSV Name: census_data.csv
```

### Installing Packages

```
Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib.pyplot
Sklearn
Xgboost

```

## Running the codes

```
Run through all the codes in Python Notebook
Each code has a comment for clarifying the purpose
The main purpose is to find out the best n_estimator for each model
```

### Break down into end to end tests

The best n_estimator in this project is by setting\
`Random Forest`: 500\
`AdaBoost`: 100\
`Gradient Boosting`: 250\
`XGBoost`: 300
